# Sprouts
02122 Software Technology Project

Project SDK should be set to Java 11.0.5 as the project was developed on this version.
Libaries lib and javafxlib should be added. For IntelliJ IDEA users, add them in Project Structure settings, and add as modules afterwards

SproutLauncher is the Main class when running Sprouts.
If there is problems when compiling or running SproutLauncher "-p pathToJavaFX\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib --add-modules=javafx.fxml,javafx.controls" should be added as VM options.

You might have to set the folder "resources" as a resource folder.
